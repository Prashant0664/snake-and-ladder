# `Snake and Ladder Game Backend`

This is the backend for the snake and ladder game application developed using Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.js. It provides various APIs for user authentication, sending emails, and game-related functionalities.

## Features

⚡  User Authentication: The backend supports user registration, login, and authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens). <br/>
⚡  Email Sending: Nodemailer is integrated to send emails for user authentication, password reset, and other notifications. <br/>
⚡  API Endpoints: The backend provides APIs for game actions, such as starting a new game, saving game progress, retrieving game data, etc. <br/>
⚡  Database Integration: MongoDB is used to store user data, game details, and other relevant information. <br/>
⚡  Security: The backend implements secure authentication mechanisms and handles data validation and sanitization. <br/>

## Technologies Used

⚡  Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for server-side development. <br/>
⚡  Express.js: A minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js. <br/>
⚡  MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for data storage. <br/>
⚡  Nodemailer: A module for sending emails from Node.js applications. <br/>
